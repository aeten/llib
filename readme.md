## A Compact C Utilities Library

Since we are now in the 21st century, this uses C99, but is compatible with
MSVC when compiled as C++.  This leads to some 'unnecessary' casting to keep
C++ happy, but working in the intersection between C99 and MSVC C++ makes this
library very portable.

It has been tested on Windows 7 64-bit (mingw and MSVC), and both Linux 32-bit and
64-bit.
