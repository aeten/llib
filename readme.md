## A Compact C Utilities Library

Since we are now in the 21st century, this uses C99, but is compatible with
MSVC when compiled as C++.  This leads to some 'unnecessary' casting to keep
C++ happy, but working in the intersection between C99 and MSVC C++ makes this
library very portable.

It has been tested on Windows 7 64-bit (mingw and MSVC), and both Linux 32-bit and
64-bit.

There are a number of kitchen-sink extended C libraries like glibc and the
Apache Portable Runtime but these are big and awkward to use on all platforms.
llib aims to be small as possible and intended for _static_ linking with your
application (the BSD licensing should help with this).

llib provides a refcounting mechanism, extended string functions,dynamically-resizable arrays,
doubly-linked lists and maps using binary trees. The aim of this first release is
not to produce the most efficient code possible but to explore the API and validate
the refcounting semantics.

A note on style: although C has been heavily influenced by C++ over the years,
it remains C. So judicious use of statement macros like `FOR` is fine, if they
are suitably hygenic.

## Reference Counting

llib provides refcounted arrays, which contain their own size. You do not ever use
`free` on objects created by llib, and instead use `obj_unref`.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <llib/obj.h>

int main()
{
    int *ai = array_new(int,10);
    for (int i = 0, n = array_len(ai); i < n; ++i)
        ai[i] = 10.0*i;
    ...
    obj_unref(ai);
    return 0;
}
```
C does not have smart pointers, but dumb pointers with hidden secrets. All objects
are over-allocated, with a hidden header behind the pointer. If the object is an
array, it keeps track of its size, otherwise contains a pointer to a function
which acts as a 'destructor' for the object. Objects start out with a reference
count of 1, and the macro `obj_ref` increments this count; if un-referenced and the
count is zero, then we call the destructor and free the memory.


```C
typedef struct ObjHeader_ {
    union {
      DisposeFn dtor;
      uint32 len;
    } x;
    unsigned int _ref:15;
    unsigned int is_array:1;
    unsigned int is_ref_container:1;
    unsigned int mlen:15;
} ObjHeader;
```

This allows for objects to safely _share_ other objects without having to fully
take ownership.  Reference counting cuts down on the amount of 'defensive copying'
needed in typical code.

Unless you specifically define `OBJ_REF_ABBREV`, the basic operations are named
`ref` and `unref`; there is also an alias `dispose` for `obj_unref_v` which
un-references multiple objects.

It is straightforward to create new objects which fit with llib's object scheme:

```C
typedef struct {
    int *ages;
} Bonzo;

static void Bonzo_dispose(Bonzo *self) {
    printf("disposing Bonzo\n");
    unref(self->ages);
}

Bonzo *Bonzo_new(int *ages) {
    Bonzo *self = obj_new(Bonzo,Bonzo_dispose);
    self->ages = ref(ages);
    return self;
}

void test_bonzo() {
    int AGES[] = {45,42,30,16,17};
    int *ages = array_new(int,5);

    FOR(i,5) ages[i] = AGES[i];  //??

    Bonzo *b = Bonzo_new(ages);

    unref(ages);

    printf("%d %d\n",b->ages[0],b->ages[1]);

    unref(b);
}
```

There is nothing special about such structures; when creating them with the macro
`obj_new` you can provide a dispose function. In this case, `Bonzo` objects
reference the array of ages, and they un-reference this array when they are finally
disposed.  The test function releases the array `ages`, and thereafter the only
reference to `ages` is kept within the struct.

This scheme will only add a few Kb code to an application. ??

Arrays can be _reference containers_ which hold refcounted objects:

```C
    Bonzo *dogs = array_new_ref(Bonzo,3);
    // see? They all happily share the same ages array!
    dogs[0] = Bonzo_new(ages);
    dogs[1] = Bonzo_new(ages);
    dogs[2] = Bonzo_new(ages);
    ...
    // this un-references the Bonzo objects
    unref(dogs);
```

## Sequences

llib provides resizable arrays, called 'seqs'.

```C
float **s = seq_new(float);
seq_add(s,1.2);
seq_add(s,5.2);
....
float *arr = ref(*s);
unref(s);

// array still lives!
FOR(i,array_len(arr)) printf("%f ",arr[i]);
printf("\n");

```

You treat seqs like a pointer to an array, and use `seq_add` to ensure that the
array is resized when needed.  `*s` is _always_ a valid llib array, and in particular
`array_len` returns the correct size.

A seq keeps a reference to this array, and to get a reference to the array you
can just say `ref(*s)` and then it's fine to dispose of the seq itself. The function
`seq_array_ref` combines these two operations of sharing the array and disposing
the seq. (resize to fit??)

These can also explicitly be _reference containers_ which derereference their objects
afterwards if you use `seq_new_ref`.
